description=Apply QML style files to new layers.
    QML files are stored in {qgis_home}\Styles directory.
    QML files will be applied to a vector layer when the QML file's basename 
    is found as a substring of the new layer's name.
    QML files will be applied to a raster layer when the QML file's label token 
    is found as a substring of the new layer's name. The label token is raster_style_{label}.qml.
